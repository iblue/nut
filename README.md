# New Universal Time (NUT)

A new time format for the world.

## Concept

We are using the following units:

1 day: 86400 (that is 24*60*60 seconds)
1 year: 365 days (or 365 days in a leap year)

A year begins at the day of the vernal equinox on 0 UTC (in the next few
years, the date is march 20th).

A day begins at 0:00 UTC.

The current year is 2014.

The date is given by the number of the year followed by a space followed
by the number of the current day.

The time of the day is given in ks (kiloseconds).
